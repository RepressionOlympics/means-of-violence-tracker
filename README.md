# Means of Violence Tracker

Based on the writings of sociologist Max Weber, states are administrative authorities who hold a [monopoly on the legitimite use of physical force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_on_violence). The project serves to track in detail physical instituions (people, buildings, other infrustructure) who hold the power towards legitimite use of physical force.
